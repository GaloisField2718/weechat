## Channels

### Connect and join

To connect to a server (basic with Weechat).

`/connect libera`

`/join #channel` (First, `#libera` or `#bitcoin`)

List all available channels into a server: `/list`

### Info about a channel 

Info: `/msg ChanServ INFO #channel`

`[+Cnst]` meaning: 

- +C: This mode blocks messages containing mIRC color codes. It is used to keep the channel free from colored text, which can be a preference for readability or style consistency.

- +n: This mode ensures that messages cannot be sent to the channel by users who are not present in the channel. It's a common setting used to prevent spamming from users outside the channel.

- +s: This makes the channel secret. A secret channel does not appear in the channel list when someone performs a /list command. It's useful for privacy, keeping the channel hidden from general visibility.

- +t: This mode restricts the ability to change the channel topic to channel operators only. It prevents regular users from altering the channel's topic, maintaining control over the channelâ€™s description or topic consistency.

Check current mode: `/mode #channel`

### Chat

To apostrophe someone: `Nickname: Hello, how are you today?`

To open a private chat: `/query Nickname`

To send a private message: `/msg Alice Hello, this is a private message!`

**List nicknames**: `/n #channel`

Command: `/n` is a shortcut for names. You can try `/help names` for more info.


### Modify a channel

If administrator. When you create a channel you are the default admin. 

Set topic: `/topic Channel description`

With admin you can lock everything with: `/msg ChanServ SET #channel MLOCK +Cnst`

To remove secret (for example) it's: `/msg ChanServ SET #channel MLOCK -s`

## Some useful commands

Check directories: `/debug dirs`

Filter who join, part, quit: `/filter add joinquit * irc_join,irc_part,irc_quit *`
To remove the filter: `/filter del joinquit`
